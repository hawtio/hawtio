      <p><strong>hawt.io</strong> helps you look inside any JVM along with having plugins for working with
        <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">Apache ActiveMQ</a>, <a
              href="http://camel.apache.org/">Camel</a> and <a href="http://karaf.apache.org/">Karaf</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Click on the tree on the left of the window to browse the various services which are running in this JVM.</p>

      <p>As you select different folders and MBeans you will notice the list of tabs at the top left of the screen
        update to reflect the available features.</p>

      <p>You can connect to a different JVM via its Jolokia URL via the <a href="/#preferences">Preferences</a> tab</p>

      <p>For more help please select the next tabs above.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane well" title="ActiveMQ" value="activemq">
      <p>Click on the <a ng-href="/#help/activemq?nid=root_org.apache.activemq">org.apache.activemq</a> node in the tree
        which then exposes the brokers running in a JVM (if
        there is one)</p>

      <p>Within the <a ng-href="/#help/activemq?nid=root_org.apache.activemq">org.apache.activemq</a> node you can click
        on the <b>Queue</b> node to see the queues and <b>Topic</b>
        to see the topics. From either of these nodes you should see a <b>Create Queue</b> or <b>Create Topic</b> tab to
        be able to create new destinations.</p>

      <p>Once you have selected a destination you should be able to <b>Send</b> to it, <b>Browse</b> a queue or view the
        <b>Attributes</b> or <b>Charts</b></p>

      <p>You can also see a graphical view of all producers, destinations and consumers for all queues (or if you select
        a Topic folder then topics) using the <b>Diagram</b> tab. Selecting a single queue or topic shows just all the
        producers and consumers on that destination. This diagram makes it easy to spot if producers are sending
        messages when there are no consumers, or that consumers are on the wrong destination etc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane well" title="Camel" value="camel">
      <p>Click on the <a ng-href="/#help/camel?nid=root_org.apache.camel">org.apache.camel</a> node in the tree which
        then exposes any Camel Context running in a JVM (if
        there is one)</p>

      <p>The various child nodes of <a ng-href="/#help/camel?nid=root_org.apache.camel">org.apache.camel</a> lets you
        view the <b>Attributes</b> or <b>Charts</b> of the
        various JMX MBeans</p>

      <p>You can use the <b>Diagram</b> tab to view a graphical representation of the running routes. If you select a
        single route instance then the diagram just shows that route only.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane well" title="JVM" value="jvm">
      <p>Click on the <a ng-href="/#help/jvm?nid=root_java.lang">java.lang</a> node in the tree to view numerous JVM
        level metrics
        such as <a ng-href="/#help/jvm?nid=root_java.lang_OperatingSystem">OperatingSystem</a>.
      </p>

      <p>The various child nodes of <a ng-href="/#help/jvm?nid=root_java.lang">java.lang</a> lets you view the <b>Attributes</b>
        or <b>Charts</b> of the various JMX MBeans.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click on the <a href="/#logs">Logs</a> tab to be able to view and search the JVM's logging files (for slf4l and log4j).
