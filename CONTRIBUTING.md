We love contributions! We really need your help to make [hawtio](http://hawt.io/) even more hawt, so please [join our community](http://hawt.io/community/index.html)!

Many thanks to all of our [existing contributors](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/graphs/contributors)! But we're greedy, we want more! hawtio is _hawt_, but it can be _hawter_! :)

Here's some notes to help you get started:

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) as you'll need it to submit issues, comments or pull requests.
* Got any ideas for how we can improve hawtio? Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/issues?state=open) with your thoughts. Constructive criticism is always greatly appreciated!
* Fancy submitting [any nice screenshots of how you're using hawtio?](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/tree/master/website/src/images/screenshots) A quick Youtube screencast would be even _hawter_ or a blog post/article we can link to? Just [submit an issue](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/issues?state=open) (or fork and patch the [website](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/tree/master/website/src/) or any Markdown docs in our repository directly) and we'll merge it into our website.
* Search [our issue tracker](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/issues?state=open) and see if there's been any ideas or issues reported for what you had in mind; if so please join the conversation in the comments.
* Submit any issues, feature requests or improvement ideas [our issue tracker](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio/issues?state=open).
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub then you can hack on the code. We love any contribution such as:
   * fixing typos
