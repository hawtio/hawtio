### Change Log

#### 1.5.2 (To be released)

* Added a new java.lang.Runtime plugin
* IDE plugin modification and update
* Various fixes and improvements
* Upgraded to Camel 2.19.1
* Upgraded to JGit 4.8.x

#### 1.5.1

* New Diagnostics plugin using JVM Flight Recorder
* Proxy whitelist is automatically constructed based on network interfaces for local machine.
  You can continue to use `hawtio.proxyWhitelist` system properties for further customisation.
* Proxy whitelist supports regex by prefixing them with `r:` in the `hawtio.proxyWhitelist` system property
* Upgraded to Camel 2.19.0
* Upgraded to Spring Boot 1.5.3
* Upgraded to Jolokia 1.3.6
* Upgraded to JGit 4.7.x
* Various bug fixes

#### 1.5.0

* Hawtio 1.5 requires Java 1.8 onwards
* Turned `ProxyServlet` to whitelist-based host selection model for security reasons.
  Now only `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` is allowed in the remote JVM connect plugin by default.
  To connect to other hosts you need to add them to whitelist either at `proxyWhitelist`
  init parameter in `web.xml` or through `hawtio.proxyWhitelist` system property.
* Upgraded to Camel 2.18.2
* Upgraded to Spring Boot 1.5.1

Hawtio 1.4.x is now in maintenance mode.

#### 1.4.68

* Fixed hawtio-wildfly to run on WildFly / JBoss EAP even after JBoss RBAC is enabled
* Fixed an issue whereby many pages where flickering
* Upgraded to Camel 2.18.1
* The Karaf Terminal plugin now works again when using Karaf 4.0.7 or newer.

#### 1.4.67

* Fixed hawtio-app may not start due two different versions of http-client included.

#### 1.4.66

* Now every Jolokia call within Hawtio is checked based on RBAC. This means Hawtio is made more secure, but
  you may also encounter a bunch of access exceptions. Most of those exceptions are not a Hawtio bug, but
  just indicate lack of some necessary RBAC configurations on the container, e.g. Karaf ACL files.
  You can resolve those exceptions by fulfilling the required configurations on the running container.
* Added support for customization of Jolokia through Java system properties, i.e.:
  `-Djolokia.policyLocation=file:///home/fuse/my-access.xml`
* Added new pages to the ActiveMQ plugin for monitoring brokers with large number of destinations
* Improved KeyCloak plugin to better support WildFly and EAP
* Various fixes and improvements for RBAC on Hawtio web UI
* Upgraded to Camel 2.18.0
* Upgraded to Jolokia 1.3.5
* KeyCloak updated to 2.2.1

#### 1.4.65

* Upgraded to Camel 2.17.1
* The Camel JMX domain name can be configured in the preference
* Various other small bug fixes

#### 1.4.64

* Added more icons for various Camel endpoints and a few more EIPs
* Upgraded to Camel 2.17.0
* Various other small bug fixes

#### 1.4.63

* hawtio can be installed in Apache Karaf 2.4.x again if you install the `hawtio-core` feature. Log and Terminal plugin is not supported on Karaf 2.x.
* upgraded to KeyCloack 1.9.1

#### 1.4.62

* Add `hawtio:type=security,name=RBACRegistry` JMX bean that provides optimized version of Jolokia `list` operation.
  Normally, Jolokia fetches and marshalls each MBeanInfo it can find. When there are thousands of same MBeanInfos
  (like ActiveMQ queues or Camel processors/endpoints/routes/...) it was very inefficient. Now the MBeanInfo
  is shared in special cases which greatly improves performance.
* When displaying a table of JMX attributes for a list of MBeans, data is fetched only for visible (non-filtered)
  objects. After clearing/changing filter, old Jolokia requests are unregistered and new ones are created.
* Fixed the AcitveMQ plugin to show the browse message dialog again, after it has been closed previously.
* Increased the default jolokia max collection limit from 5000 to 50000 to ensure JVMs with many mbeans are all populated in hawtio
* Removed a bunch of outdated help pages in the plugins to trim down the distribution size.
* Added back the missing icons for the Camel debugger which was missing in the previous release.
* Add option to control whether hawtio should automatic open the web console in the browser or not, when running hawtio-app.
* Hawtio now supports url links to auto connect remote JVMs where the options is provided as url parameters in the link.
      such as: /hawtio/index.html#/jvm/connect?name=xxx&host=xxx&port=xxx&path=xxx&userName=xxx&password=xxx
      (where you replace xxx with the desired values)

#### 1.4.61

* ActiveMQ browse messages now show the table quicker when data retrieved
* ActiveMQ move dialog uses a selectbox instead of type ahead which could be buggy in some browsers
* Upgrade to Jolokia 1.3.3
* Jolokia is set to not return error details to avoid exposing stacktraces from the JVMs

#### 1.4.60

* Fixed hawtio-app to scan for 3rd party plugins in `--pluginsDir` to work on Windows
* Added a copy to clipboard button on the Camel and ActiveMQ message browser

#### 1.4.58

* When using ActiveMQ the hawtio web console no longer causing the tree to continuesly being updated, which otherwise will cause the web UI to be sluggish. Notice the reason for the update is becuse of ActiveMQ and end user may not use pooled connections or is using XA with no consumer cache. In either case hawtio now filter out those events to avoid triggering the web console UI to be updated constantly.
* The hawtio-maven-plugin now waits 3 seconds before opening the web-console which allows the JVM to startip Camel and other services to be ready prior to the web console. The delay can be configured.
* The karaf terminal plugin requires Karaf 4.x (2.x/3.x no longer supported)
* Upgraded to Camel 2.16.1

#### 1.4.57

#### 1.4.56

* Camel plugin - Now groups the properties into tabs so viewing endpoint properties with many options is using multi-tabs to group the options.
* Added camel-cdi as goal to the [maven](http://hawt.io/maven/) plugin to allow starting a Camel CDI application with hawtio embedded.
* Fixed so JUnit plugin is not shown by default when there is no unit tests in the JVM to run.
* Removed the kubernetes plugin which are only part of hawtio 2.x
* Remove the apollo plugin as it was never complete and ActiveMQ Apollo is a dead project.
* Ported the fabric8-insight-log to hawtio-insight-log so we have the source code and maintain out of the box in the hawtio project
